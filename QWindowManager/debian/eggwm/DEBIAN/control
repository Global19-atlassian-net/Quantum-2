Description: EggWM is a window manager based on Qt 4 and Xlib.
 There are many X11 window managers, each with different philosophies and it is
 precisely this that differentiates EggWM the other window managers.
 The EggWM objectives are:
 - Maintain a simple and well documented source code.
 - Being compatible with the freedesktop.org standards for window managers.
 - Maintain a low consumption of resources without neglecting the usability and appearance.
 - Allow to manage windows through gestures with Touchégg (https://code.google.com/p/touchegg/).
