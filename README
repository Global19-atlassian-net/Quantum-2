About The Chipara Project

The Chipara Project's aim is to create a complete uniformed Hybrid C++/JavaScript 
Hardware, Software & Operating System Development Framework, a modular all in one 
solution to building "System, Desktop, Web, Multimedia, and Game Applications. Doing 
all of this and still keeping 4 key concepts in mind, "Design, Style, Construct, Deploy" 
and 5 rules of engagement.

   1.  Easy To Use
   2.  Documentation
   3.  Support
   4.  Features
