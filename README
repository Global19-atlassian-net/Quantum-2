About The Chipara Project

The Chipara Project's aim is to create a complete uniformed Hybrid C++/JavaScript 
Hardware, Software & Operating System Development Framework, a modular all in one 
solution to building "System, Desktop, Web, Multimedia, and Game Applications. Doing 
all of this and still keeping 4 key concepts in mind, "Design, Style, Construct, Deploy" 
and 5 rules of engagement.

   1.  Easy To Use
   2.  Documentation
   3.  Support
   4.  Features
   5.  and KISS "Keep It Simple Sam!" :) 


QDesktop is a application that gives you a Desktop Wallpaper, Icons, Right Click-Menus, Its simular
to xfce4's Desktop Application but written in Qt4

All software that you find here can be licensed under any GPL compatable license.

So if you want to use QDesktop under a BSD or GPL3 licenses then
that's fine.

All that I ask is any contribution's made to this project does the
same.
