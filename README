About The Chipara Project

The Chipara Project's aim is to create a complete uniformed Hybrid C++/JavaScript 
Hardware, Software & Operating System Development Framework, a modular all in one 
solution to building "System, Desktop, Web, Multimedia, and Game Applications. Doing 
all of this and still keeping 4 key concepts in mind, "Design, Style, Construct, Deploy" 
and 5 rules of engagement.

   1.  Easy To Use
   2.  Documentation
   3.  Support
   4.  Features
   5.  and KISS "Keep It Simple Sam!" :) 

QDesktop is a application that gives you a Desktop Wallpaper, Icons, Right Click-Menus, Its simular
to xfce4's Desktop Application but written in Qt4


Project Licenses
The Chipara Project does not use a software licenses

This is my personal political statement. Any opens source licenses 
that preaches freedom with a list of conditions isn't free at all.
Hence there is no licenses but if you choose to have a license
then it must be a GPL compatible licenses.
